      <h2>Guide: How to Use the Lesson Recommender Demo</h2>
      <p>This demo showcases a recommendation engine for language learners, built on precalculated embeddings and cosine similarities, with weighted attributes (60% semantic title similarity, 30% language, 10% CEFR). Recommendations are generated based on the semantic similarities between lesson titles, using your three most recent bookings. Real-world engines are far more complex, incorporating advanced methods and models – for a tailored solution, <a href="mailto:akquise@ferderer.de">hire me ✉</a> as a professional!</p>
